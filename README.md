In this project, I have implemented a digital twin of my cat Kedama. The autonomous robot is based on a TM4C123G microcontroller namely TIVA C series TM4C123G by Texas instrumentals. 
The document [Autonomous Mobile robot Kedama.pdf] explaind a detailed introduction of the architecture, requirements and firmware modules implemented using the IDE Keil MDK-ARM Plus version 5.
The microcontroller development board used for this project is TM4C123 Tiva C Series LaunchPad.
